// NOTES ON USING JDBC-ODBC BRIDGE UNDER JAVA 1.3
   Copyright (c) 1996,1998,1999 IBM Corporation.


The IBM JDBC-ODBC Bridge assumes that your ODBC driver can support 
concurrency and you are expected to provide locking in your application 
if necessary.

To use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge, you need to set up your own ODBC driver to
work with the target database.  You should only set up the JDBC-ODBC bridge
after you have successfully tested your ODBC driver.

A C program, odbctest.c, calling ODBC API is provided for you to test your
direct ODBC connection.  You need to compile and link it with your ODBC
library.  A simple Java program, bridgetest.java, is also provided for you 
to test your ODBC connection in the Java environment.  

The Bridge is used by opening a JDBC connection using a URL with the odbc
subprotocol.  Explicit loading is done with the following line of code:

        Class.forName ("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");

When loaded, the ODBC driver creates an instance of itself and registers
this with the JDBC driver manager.

The Bridge driver uses the odbc subprotocol.  URLs for this subprotocol
are of the form:

        jdbc:odbc:<data-source-name>[<attribute-name>=<attribute-value>]*

for example

        jdbc:odbc:databasename
        jdbc:odbc:mydb;UID=me;PWD=secret
