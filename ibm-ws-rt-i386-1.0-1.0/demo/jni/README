README.txt

The FileStat class demonstrates the usage of native calls in Java through
JNI. This class is provided for access to the underlying stat(2) subroutine,
which may be needed for getting the information about the file named by
the path parameter. Read, write, or execute permission for the named
file is not required, but all directories listed in the path leading to
the file must be searchable.

This FileStat class demonstrates access to stat(2) functionality in Java.

Though it supports the same basic functionality as the C stat(2) API,
this class currently contains only the important fields like inode, mode,
nlink, uid, gid, size, atime, mtime & ctime. See man pages of stat(2) for
info on C API.

FileStat.java is the class, FileStat.c is the supporting JNI code.

FileStatDemo.java is a sample application which uses the FileStat class
to get the information of the specified file <file>.

To build the FileStat class and FileStatDemo class :
 javac FileStatDemo.java

To generate the shared library libFileStat.so, run

	gcc  -shared -o libFileStat.so -I<SDK_PATH>/include FileStat.c

Note: When compiling for PowerPC 64-bit JVM, please pass `-m64' option to gcc.

where <SDK_PATH> is path to installed SDK directory.

Please read the man pages of gcc for details on generating shared library.

You will need to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to search the directory 
containing libFileStat.so.

To run the Demo:
	java FileStatDemo <file>
