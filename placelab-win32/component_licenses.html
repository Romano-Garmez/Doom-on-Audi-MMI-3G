Place Lab was built using open-source and other redistributable components.
The HTTP proxy was written by Johannes Plachy and JDBM was developed by Alex
Boisvert.  The Bluetooth Spotter uses <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluecove/">BlueCove</a>, an open-source
implementation of the JSR-82. Communication with serial GPS units is handled
through <a href="http://rxtx.org">rxtx</a>.  <a
href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/"> Hsqldb</a> and <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/"> MySQL Connector/J</a> are
included.  The Place Lab distribution also includes SWT and the J9 runtime,
both from IBM. Here are the <a HREF="http://placelab.org/toolkit/doc/complic.html">
license agreements</a> for these components.
